It has a Target database:
SenseSmartMarkers
found over at:
https://developer.vuforia.com/targetmanager/singleDeviceTarget/deviceSingleImageTargetDetails


It has just one marker named:
ssrlogo_w0p275m_h0p144m
and has the Target ID:
eed385f01b6d4f11a32a43304d6deb2f
It is the Sebser Smart Region logo, and when printed out on A4 it has a width of 0.275m and a height of 0.144m.
This becomes very important for the stereo rendering of the hololense since spatial depth factors into rendering
"exactly" where an AR entity should be placed in real-life-spatial context with regards to the HMD

One must download the target database, and import it into unity.
Within this repo is such a DB.
